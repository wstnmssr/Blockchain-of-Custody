# Blockchain-of-Custody
##2020 HackCU project at the intersection of digital forensics and the backbone of Blockchain

*Initiated by Westin Musser at HackCU 2020 - Feb.23-4*

Fresh in my mind were the concepts I collided in this proiject when I decided this use case is completely viable. 

The chain of custody can be an absolute hassle for a digital forensics investigator. Keep highly detailed notes on the whereabouts of any evidence that makes a difference in court. Slip up in the slightest and the defense will guarantee that your exhibits are thrown out of court. Invalidating good evidence cripples out justice system. Therefore, why not take advantage of the futuristic technologies that we as technologists have access to today? The immutable nature of the blockchain enables investigators to circumvent the possibility of their untampered evidence being misrepresented.
